Since I've noticed that you may customize the screensaver for the Onyx Boox Note Air, I searched the web for some nice screensavers but there were none.
So I had to create my own. I've chosen (as always) mountains for the background.

At the time of creating this screensaver, I was reading Reinhold Messners Book `Ãœber Leben`,
so I chose to take the dolomites for the background. More specifically, these are the [Geisler Spitzen](https://www.google.at/maps/place/Odlegruppa/) in Messner's hometown.

Since this ebook reader does have a E-Ink display, I had to make it black and white and increase contrast.
I also added a nice quote from George RR Martin (the auther of Game of Thrones).

The mountains and the quote makes the screensaver perfect for anyone who loves reading and moutaineering at the same time.
The quote's font is called `Cookie`.
