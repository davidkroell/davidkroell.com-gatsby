When I'm doing mockup prototyping for user interfaces, I still prefer painting by hand rather than using mockup tools.
I feel confident with [draw.io](https://draw.io/), but not for the first prototyping session.
There you just have to be creative. And creativity does not come from a UI design tool.

Since I just got a new Onyx Note Boox Air, I've created new templates for mobile device mockups.
There are three version inside the package, two iPhone and an Android mockup.

### Installation

Just download them and put them onto your device in the `noteTemplate` directory.

### Download

The templates are available from my GitHub repository:
[Download the templates](https://github.com/davidkroell/davidkroell.com/tree/main/content/blogposts/2020/custom-mockups-for-onyx-boox-note-air)

There is also a GIMP source file here.
