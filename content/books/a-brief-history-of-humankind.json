    "description": "In his book, Harari talks about how humankind developed into what it is today - and above all why. The author clarifies things that most people think they already know. He talks about how religions, societies and capitalism evolved (just to name a few).",
    "recommendetFor": "The book opened my eyes in many ways and showed one thing above all: life is never fair and it doesn't always get easier. I recommend it for everyone who believes one can learn from history."
